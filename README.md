# LittleLight

LittleLight is a simple wrapper written in Ruby to make API calls to the Destiny 2 database. The majority of methods only require you to supply an api-key, however some methods require Oauth2 authentication (which is not provided by this gem in any capacity).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'little_light'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install little_light

## Usage

A prerequisite to using this gem is having a valid api-key from Bungie. Without an api-key you will not be able to call any methods successfully.

To start off you need to instantiate the Client and supply it with an api-key as a parameter.
```ruby
client = LittleLight::Client("api-key")
```
Once you have instantiated the client you can call any methods in the lib folder on the client with the required parameters

ex/
```ruby
client.search_bungie_net_by_username("robbinthehood") => returns an object with of all usernames containing the string "robbinthehood"
```
You can find all the methods available to use in the lib folder, along with comments about what you should expect it to return, required params, as well as some links to destiny api docs for certain params.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
